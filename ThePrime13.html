        <br><b>Prima</b> the leader of the 13 and the very 1st Prime. Hence why I call him: <i>Big Boss</i>
        The 1st <i><u>Matrix</u></i> bearer <b>Prima</b> is a warrior of light and was the most similar to their creator, <b>Primus</b> out of all of his siblings. Cast in the mold of Primus 
        himself, <b>Prima</b> did have a strong verdict that he was always right did make him hard to deal with at times. However he was thankfully self aware enough
        so as to <b>not</b> be a <i>Pompous Gas-Bag Prime</i> (<b>Sentinel</b> I'm looking at you <b><i>*insert surprised Sentichu face here*</i></b>).
        He was also the 1st wielder of the <i><u>Star Saber</u></i>. This mystic sword <u>can only be wielded by a Prime</u>. In an episode of 
        <i>Transformers Prime</i> the Decepticons unearth the glowing blue blade with the hilt jutting out of a rock and nobody except 
        <b>Optimus Prime</b> could pull the sword from the stone. So of course I'm gonna call the original wielder of 
        <i><u>Cybertronian Excalibur</u></i> <i>Cyber King Arthur!</i>

        <br><b><i><u>My Depiction of the Character</u></i></b> 
        <br> <b>Prima</b> is a natural born leader. Strong, brave, the physical embodiment of good and light. He cares about his people although at times can be a 
        little, <i>weeeeellllll,</i> frustrating. He sees everything in black and white. Shades of gray are a concept that he can never seem to grasp. 
        That isn't to say he is a fool. Quite the contrary in fact this bot is a wise leader with a very solid sense of what is right. He may cause his siblings to
        want to tear out their - well, I guess they don't really have hair or at least most of them don't but you get what I mean - but they know they can rely on him
        to be there and fight along side them when the time comes. A literal <i>white knight</i> they know that <b>Prima</b> will never give up and run away. 1 of the 
        noblest of mechs, and filled with honor, he will fight and fight until the bitter end. A mech truly worthy of the <i><u>Matrix</u></i>, <b>Prima</b> serves as 
        a role model for the many Primes and leaders of Cybertron to come after.

        <br> <b> Vector</b> the 2nd prime created by the Cybertronian creator god Primus. This <i>time master</i> is the weilder of the 
        <b><i><u>Blades of Time</u></i></b> which allow him to manipulate the very fabric of time and space as he saw fit; like a space time fashion designer! 
        Also in his possession was a badge. Just a badge. Nothing too specially extraordinary or powerful about it. That is known of at least.
