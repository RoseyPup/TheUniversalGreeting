        <h3 class="name">Prima</h3>
        <br>
        <div><b>Prima</b> the leader of the 13 and the very 1st Prime. Hence why I call him: <i>Big Boss</i> The 1st <i>Matrix</i> bearer <b>Prima</b> is a 
        warrior of light and was the most similar to their creator, <b>Primus</b> out of all of his siblings. Cast in the mold of Primus 
        himself, <b>Prima</b> did have a strong verdict that he was always right did make him hard to deal with at times. However he was thankfully self aware enough
        so as to <b>not</b> be a <i>Pompous Gas-Bag Prime</i> (<b>Sentinel</b> I'm looking at you <b><i>*insert surprised Sentichu face here*</i></b>).
        He was also the 1st wielder of the <i>Star Saber</i>. This mystic sword <u>can only be wielded by a Prime</u>. In an episode of 
        <i>Transformers Prime</i> the Decepticons unearth the glowing blue blade with the hilt jutting out of a rock and nobody except 
        <b>Optimus Prime</b> could pull the sword from the stone. So of course I'm gonna call the original wielder of 
        <i>Cybertronian Excalibur</i> <b>Cyber King Arthur!</b></div>
        <br>
        <br><h3 class="depiction"><u style="color: #571a8e;">My Depiction of the Character</u></h3>
        <br> 
        <div><b>Prima</b> is a natural born leader. Strong, brave, the physical embodiment of good and light. He cares about his people although at times can be a 
            little, <i>weeeeellllll,</i> frustrating. He sees everything in black and white. Shades of gray are a concept that he can never seem to grasp. That isn't
            to say he is a fool. Quite the contrary in fact this bot is a wise leader with a very solid sense of what is right. He may cause his siblings to want to 
            tear out their - well, I guess they don't really have hair or at least most of them don't but you get what I mean - but they know they can rely on him to 
            be there and fight along side them when the time comes. A literal <i>white knight</i> they know that <b>Prima</b> will never give up and run away. 1 of the 
            noblest of mechs, and filled with honor, he will fight and fight until the bitter end. A mech truly worthy of the <i><u>Matrix</u></i>, <b>Prima</b> serves 
            as a role model for the many Primes and leaders of Cybertron to come after.</div>

        <h3 class="name">Vector Prime</h3>
        <br> 
        <div><b> Vector</b> the 2nd prime created by the Cybertronian creator god Primus. This <i>time master</i> is the weilder of the 
        <i>Blades of Time</i> which allow him to manipulate the very fabric of time and space as he saw fit; like a space time fashion designer! 
        Also in his possession was a badge. Just a badge. Nothing too specially extraordinary or powerful about it. That is known of at least.</div> 
        <br>
        <br><h3 class="depiction"><u style="color: #571a8e;">My Depiction of the Character</u></h3>
        <br> 
        <div><b>Vector Prime</b> is a wise and seriously stern bot. By himself he has a faint gift of foresight, sometimes recieving visions of what's to come. However,
            these visions come at random times and don't really make any sense. Sometimes all he has is visual without audio, sometimes the other way around. There
            are also times when he has both visual and audio although like always they are a bit muddled and hard to make out. The clearer the vision, the closer it 
            is to happening. Through his <i>Blades of Time</i>, <b>Vector</b> can better hone his abilities. The further in time he can look back, and 
            he can also look into the past as well. Not only can he see the past, present, and future of his home Universe, but the Blades allow him to witness 
            events and travel to other universes in the multiverse. It is not uncommon to find Vector in his Sanctum in some form of deep meditation, looking through 
            time and space. It is impossible to snap him out of this state, only by his will can he come out of it. Now that I think about it, I guess V and his 
            Blades can be compared to Doctor Strange and his Eye of Agamotto. </div>
